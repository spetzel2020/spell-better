# BUGS
- New Category dialog does't use the category checkbox yet (need to reword)
- Need Move Up/Down for custom categories

# FEATURES

# FIXED BUGS
- The custom categories are remarkably persistent when when I think i've deleted them
- Can't drag-and-drop within the spell sheet
- Not saving the collapsed/shown status (because we are reloading each time)
FIXED? - Currently, Inventory+ is incompatible with the SpellSheet
    - Seems to be working
FIXED Clicking on  any part of a category header toggles collapsed/shown , even if you're editing spell slots
    - Only if you click on the toggle now
FIXED Spell slots should move to the top, or need to be not hard-coded by category
    - spell slots are copied to standard categories

# COMPLETED FEATURES
0.5.1r:  Need to store version in the flags so that we know whether they need to be upgraded in place    
- Dialog to create a new category with filters and templates
