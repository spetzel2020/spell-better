# BUGS

- Need Edit for custom catgeories
>>> - Default should be that OTHER filters (even without a custom category) do not show one with a Custom Category
    - just like we have for the standard categories

# FEATURES
- Filter selection should be multi-select
- Make Rituals a standard Category
- Need examples of how to use:
    - Wanted Spells: Create a custom category called Wanted, and check the Show Only in Category checkbox
    - Spells in a found Spellbook: Same. When you transfer it to your Spellbook, simply create a new version
    - Show all Rituals: Filter on Ritual
- Make a pluggable Spellbook


# FIXED BUGS
- The custom categories are remarkably persistent when when I think i've deleted them
- Can't drag-and-drop within the spell sheet
- Not saving the collapsed/shown status (because we are reloading each time)
FIXED? - Currently, Inventory+ is incompatible with the SpellSheet
    - Seems to be working
FIXED Clicking on  any part of a category header toggles collapsed/shown , even if you're editing spell slots
    - Only if you click on the toggle now
FIXED Spell slots should move to the top, or need to be not hard-coded by category
    - spell slots are copied to standard categories
FIXED - New Category dialog does't use the category checkbox yet (need to reword)
FIXED - Need Move Up/Down for custom categories
# COMPLETED FEATURES
0.5.1r:  Need to store version in the flags so that we know whether they need to be upgraded in place    
- Dialog to create a new category with filters and templates
