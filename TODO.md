# BUGS
- Clicking on  any part of a category header toggles collapsed/shown , even if you're editing spell slots
- Spell slots should move to the top, or need to be not hard-coded by category
    - or at least should be dynamic
- The custom categories are remarkably persistent when when I think i've deleted them
- Currently, Inventory+ is incompatible with the SpellSheet
    - because it hooks to the spellsheet; we can;t change the classes without invalidating some core behavior
